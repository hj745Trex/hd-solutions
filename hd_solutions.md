# HD Solutions Co., Ltd.

**HD Solutions Co., Ltd.** (formerly **Hankook Delcam**) is a South Korean company specializing in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and smart factory automation solutions. The company plays a pivotal role in enhancing the competitiveness of Korea’s manufacturing sector, particularly in mold and die industries.[^1]

## History and Evolution

Founded in 1989 as Delcam Korea, the company initially operated as a distributor of Delcam UK’s CAM software. Following Autodesk’s acquisition of Delcam UK in 2014, Delcam Korea continued to supply Autodesk products such as PowerMill until the partnership ended in July 2022.[^2]

After the termination of the Autodesk contract, the company rebranded as HD Solutions and began distributing NCG CAM, a high-speed CAM software developed in the UK. This strategic shift marked a transition from reselling third-party software to developing and integrating proprietary automation solutions.

## Mission and Technology Leadership

HD Solutions is recognized for pioneering the use of 3D modeling in CAM systems and for generalizing high-speed machining technologies across Korea’s mold and die sector. The company has contributed to the advancement of 3-axis, 4-axis, 3+2-axis, and 5-axis machining technologies, helping manufacturers improve productivity and precision.[^1]

In recent years, HD Solutions has expanded its portfolio to include manufacturing execution systems (MES), warehouse management systems (WMS), and automation platforms compatible with smart factory environments. The company also developed a proprietary CAM solution for constant velocity joints (CVJ) used in 5-axis machining, offering a cost-effective alternative to specialized equipment.

## Corporate Philosophy

The company’s motto, “Leading national prosperity through advanced technology,” reflects its commitment to innovation and customer-centric development. HD Solutions continues to invest in R&D and collaborates with global partners to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving needs of the manufacturing industry.[^1]

## Products

HD Solutions offers advanced CAM software solutions tailored for high-speed machining, mold and die manufacturing, and smart factory integration.

### NCG CAM

**NCG CAM** is a standalone high-speed machining (HSM) CAM software developed in the UK and distributed by HD Solutions in Korea.[^3] It supports 2D, 3D, and 5-axis machining and is known for its intuitive interface, optimized toolpaths, and robust collision detection.

**Key features include:**
- Adaptive roughing and rest machining
- Automatic gouge protection for tools and holders
- Multi-axis machining strategies, including turbine blade operations
- Stock simulation and post-processing for major CNC controllers (e.g., Fanuc, Siemens, Heidenhain)[^4]

NCG CAM is widely used in industries requiring precision surface quality, such as mold and die, aerospace, and prototyping.

### HDAS (Hankook Delcam Automation Solution)

**HDAS** is HD Solutions’ proprietary automation suite designed to streamline CAM programming and integrate with smart manufacturing environments. It consists of modular components that automate key stages of the mold and die workflow.[^5]

**Modules include:**
- **Data Management**: Centralized control of CAM toolpaths, product metadata, and intellectual property
- **Electrode Automation**: Optimized machining of graphite and copper electrodes using knowledge-based templates
- **Core/Cavity Design**: Automated modeling of mold components based on expert rules and geometry recognition

HDAS is designed to reduce programming time by over 50% and is compatible with smart factory systems that support real-time monitoring and predictive analytics.

## Smart Manufacturing

HD Solutions has increasingly aligned its product strategy with the principles of smart manufacturing, a core component of Industry 4.0. Smart manufacturing integrates advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and data-driven automation to optimize production processes and improve operational efficiency.[^6]

The company's flagship automation suite, HDAS, is designed to support intelligent factory environments by enabling:
- Real-time monitoring of machining processes
- Automated electrode and core/cavity design workflows
- Centralized data management for CAM toolpaths and product metadata

These capabilities contribute to reduced programming time, improved machining accuracy, and enhanced traceability across the production lifecycle.[^5]

Smart manufacturing also enables HD Solutions to support predictive maintenance and quality assurance through sensor-driven data collection and analysis. By integrating IIoT devices and cloud-based analytics, the company helps manufacturers transition from traditional workflows to agile, data-centric operations.[^7]

HD Solutions’ approach reflects a broader industry trend toward intelligent factories, where digital tools empower workers, unify fragmented data systems, and enable AI-driven optimization across the shop floor.[^8]

## Leadership

The company is led by CEO **Yang Seung-il**, who has overseen its strategic transformation from a software distributor to a developer of intelligent manufacturing solutions.[^2]
